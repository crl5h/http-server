# sockets

## Introduction

Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communication channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different machines. Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on.

or 

a way to speak to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors

File descriptor: A file descriptor is simply an integer associated with an open file.

the `socket()` system call returns a socket file descriptor and we can communicate through it using `send()` and `recv()`

2 types of sockets:
1. Stream socket(`SOCK_STREAM`):

    Stream sockets are reliable two-way connected communication streams. It uses TCP protocol(read RFC 793)
2. Datagram sockets(`SOCK_DGRAM`):

    uses UDP protocol and Datagram sockets also use IP for routing.
    It is connectionless.
